# GPIO-control-with-xiaozhi-esp32
These are the same files from the project: xiaozhi-esp32(https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32), but I modified some of their code to work with other pins and servos using the board "bread-compact-wifi" which is designed for the ESP32s3 WROOM N16R8. The other configurations can be found in the original project.
